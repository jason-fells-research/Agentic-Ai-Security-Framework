CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK TERMS:
This work incorporates constitutional AI frameworks (ΔSUM Codex v1.0) and 
arbitration protocols (SOP-AUD-L1) developed for sovereign AI system governance. 
These frameworks are integral to the research methodology and should be 
acknowledged in derivative works.

The constitutional frameworks represent novel approaches to AI governance and 
are provided for educational, research, and practical implementation purposes. 
Organizations implementing these frameworks should adapt them to their specific 
regulatory and operational contexts.

EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE:
This comprehensive analysis is provided for educational and research purposes 
to advance understanding of agentic AI security considerations. The work combines 
theoretical frameworks with empirical case study findings to provide actionable 
insights for:

- Academic researchers in AI safety and security
- Industry professionals implementing agentic AI systems
- Policy makers developing AI governance regulations
- Technical teams building secure AI architectures
- Funding organizations supporting AI research initiatives

IMPLEMENTATION DISCLAIMER:
While this research follows rigorous academic methodology and industry best 
practices, any implementation of security measures should be thoroughly tested 
and validated in appropriate environments. The research findings are based on 
specific test conditions and may require adaptation for different systems and 
contexts.

Organizations should:
- Conduct their own security assessments
- Validate findings in their specific environments  
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Engage with cybersecurity professionals for implementation
- Consider regulatory and compliance requirements

RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE:
This research follows responsible disclosure principles:
- Technical details provided enable defense, not exploitation
- Vendors notified prior to public disclosure where applicable
- Research serves broader AI safety and security goals
- Findings contribute to academic and industry knowledge
